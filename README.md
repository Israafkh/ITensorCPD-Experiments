## Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository. To run the experiments you need to download the dataset and place it in the correct folder:

## Well dataset
This project uses the **Well dataset**. It contains a large-scale collection of machine learning datasets containing numerical simulations of a wide variety of spatiotemporal physical systems.
